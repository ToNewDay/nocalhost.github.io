#### How does Nocalhost work with workloads installed by Helm?

Nocalhost considers a service defined in config.yaml with the same name of a workload in Kubernetes cluster as the same one by default. The name of workload installed by Helm may differ from its name defined in Nocalhost config.yaml because of the fullname generated by Helm according to Chart.yaml or the name overridden mannually.

Nocalhost can find the specific services while workloads installed by Helm in the following ways:

- 
```
helm install [NAME] [CHART]
```
- 
```
helm install [NAME] [CHART] --set nameOverride=[NAME-OVERRIDE]
```
- 
```
helm install [NAME] [CHART] --set fullnameOverride=[FULLNAME-OVERRIDE]
```
