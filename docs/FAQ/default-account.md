#### This is the first time I access the administrator website and I cannot find the register link. How do I log in?

Nocalhost is not support user register by self.

You can log in with the default administrator account email and password.

The default account's Email is:
```
admin@admin.com
```
The default account's password is:
```
123456
```

After login, you can change admin user's Email and password. And add users.
